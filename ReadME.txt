Tech Solutions: Revolutionizing Voter Verification

Problem Statement:

The current manual verification process at polling booths is inefficient, time-consuming, and prone to errors and security vulnerabilities. Long queues, frustrated voters, and declining electoral participation are just some of the consequences. Outdated methods—like manual ID checks and paper-based cross-referencing—slow down the process and risk compromising election integrity.

Our Mission:
This hackathon challenges us to develop automated, secure, and scalable solutions that streamline voter verification. By leveraging cutting-edge technology—such as biometrics, blockchain, or AI-powered systems—we can make voting faster, more secure, and more accessible. Together, let’s build the future of elections: one where every vote counts, and every voter’s experience is seamless and trustworthy.
